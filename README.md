This is some basic code which I wrote to make a website.

Much of the code was what I learned from doing the Udacity course titled "Intro to Web Development," and then I decided to put it into a simple website to replace my wordpress blog. The main goal was to get me more familiar with templates, python, google application engine, html, css, and jquery.
